# Notepad
*classic fast notepad with a few modern features*

## TODO

* classic Win32 design (Win10/LTSC/Server basis)
* support Dark Mode
* remember position per file
* don't choke on large files (memory mapping)
* prevent editing the same file twice (locking)
* simple lists management (Ctrl+Shift+L)
* do not hold up shutdown
* performance requirement: blink into existence

**Maybe:**

* regex search and replace
* more than one undo step
* row numbers
* autosave
* tabs
* basic markdown?

**Questions:**

* should try for it to be vcruntime-less?
